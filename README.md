# Project2-Group9

Our project is to analyze the change in price of coal as a trading commodity.  We will be using NLP sentiment analysis and deep learning models to support our findings. These models will allow us to see the possible future trends for coal as well as insight on why it is moving the way it is.  Quandl will be the source for our datasets as we pull the prices for coal.
